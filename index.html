		<h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
	  </div>

	  <p>
		The Capitalist systems drive the commodification of urban spaces and culture in cities worldwide. As a result,
		many communal areas in urban spaces have been transformed into profit-driven commodities, erasing their original
		purpose as spaces for resistance, belonging, and creativity.</p>
		<p>This thesis aims to investigate how capitalism prioritises the commercial interests of urban development over 
		what is good for the neighbourhood - or public good. This dynamic frequently results in gentrification,
		the privatisation of public spaces, and a loss of authenticity in cultural expressions.</p> 
		<p>To deepen this understanding, the thesis examines the concept of community by exploring key ideas through the lens of existing theories, particularly focusing on the commodification of raving and club culture. Once grassroots spaces for collective expression and subcultural resistance, these venues have increasingly been co-opted by corporate interests, stripping them of their radical potential and transforming them into profit-driven enterprises. By exploring case studies of urban spaces, particularly within nightlife culture, I illustrate these dynamics and their real-world consequences.
		By addressing the global intersections of urban space, culture, community and capitalism, this essay is dedicated to 
		representing a desire to reclaim spaces that are committed to the fostering of creativity, connection and expression.

					The world is visibly decaying before our eyes, a decline accelerated
					by capitalism’s relentless grip on society and the natural world. As
					Mark Fisher argues in <em>Capitalist Realism</em> , capitalism presents itself
					as the only viable system, making it nearly impossible to imagine
					alternatives while continuing its cycle of extraction and
					commodification. This all-encompassing force that leaves no corner
					untouched, eroding both communal spaces and the environment in
					pursuit of profit.

				<p>
					My inquiry is deeply personal, as it stems from my own experiences as a graphic designer and as 
					as an individual who has witnessed firsthand this erosion of my own community and communal spaces. 
					My practise as a designer has always been motivated by politics and narratives - an approach that 
					I extend to this research. At the heart of this investigation is a critical reflection of capitalism 
					and neoliberal ideologies, which I argue are the most impactful forces behind the commodification
					 of community and the privatisation of public spaces within Europe and Western countries. I 
					 acknowledge that capitalism and commodification are global phenomena, shaping communities 
					 and public spaces beyond the regions in the scope of this essay. 

				</p>
				<p>To frame this discussion, I draw on key theoretical frameworks that dissect these processes. Mackenzie 
					Warks’ (2023) concept of raving as ‘subversive space’ offers insights into how underground communities 
					carve out spaces of resistance. While, Rene Boer’s (2023) notion of the <em>‘Smooth City’</em> highlights 
					this idea of sanitised, uniform urban landscapes produced by gentrification. These frameworks will enable 
					me to interrogate how power operates in urban and cultural contexts, revealing found tensions between 
					resistance and co-optation.</p>

				<p>My approach is both critical and speculative. This thesis not only critiques the current status quo but 
					also attempts to speculate and reimagine alternatives, informed by my own design practise and
					 the ethos of grassroots movements. A central aspect to my methodology is an exploration of how 
					 communal spaces can be reclaimed or redefined. By examining examples such as dance floors and clubs- 
					 a literal space where people physically come together for collective joy and creativity - I attempt to 
					 highlight how these types of environments resist commodification and offer small glimpses of more hopeful future.
				</p>
				<p>In naming this project ‘Rottencore’, I acknowledge the duality of decay and renewal, inherent in 
					the struggles for community and cultural agency. In the same way rotting matter nourishes new growth,
					 I envision a reclamation of spaces and cultures that hopefully defines the neoliberal agenda(s) and foster 
					 real genuine connections.  Therefore, this thesis is both a critique and a manifesto of sorts -
					  a call to resist, reimagine and rebuild. </p>

					<h3>The Capitalist enclosure </h3>
				  </div>

				  <h3>of culture and space</h3>

				<p class="no-indent">
					Rene Boer’s concept of the ‘Smooth City’ provides a compelling framework for examining the capitalist transformation of urban environments and its impact on communal spaces and culture. the Smooth City prioritises clean, controlled, and predictable environments that cater to affluent tourists and residents, leading to the systematic erasure of “rough spaces”. Diverse, informal areas that foster cultural and social dynamism. This chapter critically explores how capitalism reshapes urban space, diminishing the spontaneity and inclusivity that once defied them. 
				</p>
				<div class="sub-heading"><h4>2.2 A capitalist blueprint</h4></div>
				<p class="no-indent">Boer describes the Smooth City as an urban landscape that is characterised by homogeneity, predictability and control. He writes, ‘there is no friction, no dirt, no contrast, no noise, and no smells’, illustrating the meticulously curated environments stripped of the chaotic energy and diverse elements that give urban life a vibrant flavour. Boer further notes that, ‘the smooth City welcomes everyone but provides space for no one,’ highlighting its inherent contradiction as an inclusive yet alienating environment.

					  </span>
					  It thrives on curated aesthetics and controlled experiences, creating a facade of openness while erasing the unpredictable and organic elements that define authentic urban life. Urban life thrives on spontaneity — the unplanned encounters, the conversations with strangers, the subtle dance of different cultures coexisting in a shared space. However, these moments are disappearing. Imagine walking through a city where everything feels curated, every public space designed to discourage lingering. Boer’s description suggests that this controlled environment strips away the friction and unpredictability that once made cities so vibrant. Without these informal interactions — those types of chance exchanges between people from different classes, backgrounds, and ways of life — urban spaces risk becoming sterile and drab, losing the very energy that makes them dynamic and diverse.
					</p>
					<p>Another defining aspect of the Smooth City is in its relentless pursuit of efficiency and commercial viability. Boer illustrates how this dynamic involves the process of, ‘further blending the public domain with commercial activity’,

						  </span>
						  essentially blurring the lines between communal and consumer spaces, often at the expense of democratic engagement and inclusivity. Furthermore, Boer observes that the Smooth City, ‘is a place where everything is frictionless, yet nothing is truly free” (2023). This frictionless quality seems to stem from the idea of the meticulous planning and privatisation of spaces, which again further stifles spontaneity and creativity in favour of order and marketability.

						  It presents itself as an open and inclusive public space, its transformation embodies the very qualities that Boer critiques: 
						  hyper-curated, commercially driven, and selectively accessible. Therefore, the space fosters consumption rather than organic
						   social interactions, subtly discouraging loitering or non-commercial activity. Instead of serving as truly democratic urban 
						   common space, De Hallen exemplifies how urban renewal often repackages these communal spaces into the frictionless,
						    marketable experiences that Boer describes. Further reinforcing the blur between public and private space in a way 
							that drives away genuine community-driven use, prioritising this type of controlled engagement.  
						</p>
						<p>Under capitalism, cities are not merely places where people come to work, live and gather but have now become arenas for perpetual 
							cycle of economic growth. The aesthetic and functional aspects of urban spaces are tailored to attract these capital investments, such as housing. 
						</p>

						<div class="sub-heading"><h4>2.3 Commodification of Space</h4></div>
						<p class="no-indent">The capitalist imperative is essentially to commodify everything it touches, which fundamentally alters the purpose and accessibility of urban space. We see it everywhere from public squares, parks and other communal venues.</p>

							  and the way in which it underscores the ways in which power structures subtly, yet pervasively, dictate urban life and social interactions. These practises, that are always masked in the guise of being convenient or modern, create these homogenised city experience, which quite frankly is boring and lacking energy. Dissent and alternative modes of gathering become increasingly marginalised this way. This hegemony blurs the lines between participation and consumption, and as Boer states, it makes it ‘almost impossible to take a critical distance

								<div class="sub-heading"><h4>2.4: Cultural Erosion and the Spectacle of authenticity</h4></div>
								<p class="no-indent">Obviously, capitalism’s influence extends beyond physical spaces to cultural practices and expressions, 
									increasingly dictating where and how communities can authentically gather. Cultural practises once rooted in specific traditions 
									and communities, are forcibly being appropriated, commodified and re-packaged for mass consumption. Take, for example, how street 
									art, almost instantly is co-opted by corporations seeking to capitalise on their subcultural appeal, yet as the Smooth City notes, 
									‘graffiti tags on a newly built overpass will be quickly removed to make sure it won’t become a popular place for youngsters to add 
									their own tags.

									  , which tightly controls creative expression.
								</p>
								<p>Corporations and municipalities are curating experiences based on what they deem as acceptable, essentially limiting activities or spaces
									 where authentic community can thrive. This manufactured  spectacle of authenticity markets curated versions of culture as ‘real’ experiences. 
									 However, these commodified representations are deeply lacking depth, context and meaning of their original forms. Using the dance floor as 
									 another example, a once radical space for self-expression and communal connection - a site now that is often an area of commodification, 
									 where access is determined by ticket prices and VIP exclusivity. </p>

								<p> In a landscape where communal spaces are increasingly policed or commercialised, the question becomes: where can we still 
									go to gather, or create, or even connect in a way that feels organic and unmediated? A way that is not dictated by commercial 
									interests, surveillance, or exclusivity. But instead allows for spontaneity, accessibility, and authenticity? Where can we 
									can exist in a space without the expectation to perform, purchase or conform to to the imposed norms that dictate who belongs 
									and who does not?</p>

								<p>Nowhere is this phenomenon more apparent than in nightlife culture, where clubs and music venues once served as underground
									 sanctuaries for subcultures to form and thrive. As explored by the Urban Catalyst research project, temporary and self-organised
									  spaces have historically played a critical role in the social and cultural fabric of cities. However, under the increasing 
									  influence of neoliberal urban planning, these “rough edges” of the city-spaces that allowed for improvisation, artistic
									   expression, and inclusive gathering - have been systematically smoothed over.

					<h3>The commodified dance-floor</h3>
				  </div>

				<p>
					From the moment I was legally able to, I found joy in going out with my friends and exploring 
					the nightlife and venues that different cities had to offer. Dancing has always stirred a 
					profound feeling within me — whether it’s a rush of euphoria or an unexpected sense of calm. 
					It’s a fleeting tranquility, a moment where I feel free to move and express myself without inhibition. 
					However, in recent years, I have also become increasingly aware of how these spaces are being 
					encroached upon by an ever-expanding capitalist system. What was once authentic, 
					healing communities built on inclusivity are now being eroded, leaving behind a stark contrast 
					to their original purpose. This transformation signals the death of the dance floor.
				</p>

				<p>We must first acknowledge the origins of dance music before focusing on the dance floor and its 
				commodification. Dance music’s roots trace back to the late 1970s and 1980s, when techno emerged as
			 a response to Detroit’s post-industrial decline. The music was created as a response to the urban decay 
			 many cities in the United States faced at the time. (fig 4) </p>
			 
			 <p>Pioneers like Kevin Saunderson, Juan Atkins, and
			 Derrick May — known as the “Belleville Three” (fig 5) —
			 fused elements of soul, funk and other futuristic sounds,
			 influenced by European pioneers like Kraftwerk.

							Wark, McKenzie. <em>Raving </em>. Practices, 14 Mar. 2023.  Raving is structured more as a continuous, 
							reflective essay rather than a traditional book with titled chapters, Wark discusses the subversive potential

						</span>
					  </span> 
					  However, this potential is increasingly compromised as rave culture becomes commodified. What once emerged 
					  as a grassroots movement rooted in resistance has been appropriated, stripped of its radical intent, and 
					  repackaged for mainstream consumption. The gabber scene in The Netherlands would be another illustration 
					  of this type of commodification; originally a raw and rebellious underground movement, it was eventually 
					  absorbed into the mainstream, with its aesthetics and sound repackaged for commercial appeal, stripping it
					   of its radical root. Similarly, theorists like Hakim Bey, in Temporary Autonomous Zones,

					   argue that these ephemeral gatherings create “zones of freedom” where the oppressive forces of capital and 
					   state control momentarily disappear. These temporary spaces, though precarious and short-lived, possess 
					   the power to disrupt the sanitised, controlled, and commodified nature of contemporary nightlife. 
					   They reimagine the dance floor not just as a site of entertainment, but as a radical space for communal
					   resistance and liberation. 
					</p>
					<p>The underground rave scenes of the 1980s and 1990s, in the UK, emerged as acts of defiance against restrictive laws 
						and societal constraints. These raves provided a space that offered liberation from mainstream venues covered by 
						rigid rules, high costs and social discrimination. Raving typically took place in abandoned warehouses, fields, 
						and other hidden locations to avoid police crackdowns and evade licensing regulations that controlled nightlife 
						spaces. In contrast, large-scale music festivals, corporate-sponsored club nights, and curated playlists have 
						reduced rave culture to a marketable aesthetic, diluting its political and social significance (Fig 6).

						 <p>Awakenings exemplifies the shift from underground resistance to a commodified festival experience. Its carefully 
							curated line-ups prioritise big-name techno artists over grassroots DJs, limiting the spontaneity and inclusivity of 
							early raves. Pricing plays a crucial role in this shift as well. Unlike the free or low-cost illegal raves of the past, 
							where access was based on word-of-mouth and a sense of community rather than financial means. Awakenings tickets can be 
							expensive, ranging anywhere between €219 euros without camping and €264 euros with a camping pass.

							  This makes the entire experience exclusive and financially inaccessible to many. This shift in accessibly reflects the broader 
							  commercialisation of nightlife, were participation is entirely dictated by economic statues rather than shared passion for music and 
							  dance. Awakenings and other festivals are hosted in regulated venues with corporate sponsorships and strict security, it abandons the raw, 
							  defiant spirit of repurposed warehouses and secret locations. While preserving techno’s aesthetic, Awakenings repackages rave culture into a 
							  profitable, controlled spectacle, demonstrating how capitalism absorbs and neutralises countercultural movements by turning it into a product.
						</p>

						<p>In addition to raves, nightclubs have always served as important spaces for youth subcultures. 
							They offer an environment where people can engage in forming their own identity, self-expression 
							and a sense of belonging to a social group. In the frame of these spaces, music, style, and shared 
							experiences become key tools for navigating personal and collective identities. Within these spaces, 
							they offer a momentary escape from social constraints and expectations.

							   potential into these “spaces of representation”, which are then restructured to align with

							   radical potential have been restricted to align with dominant capitalist and political ideologies. 

						</p>

					<p> A particularly striking example of this shift can be found in Tel Aviv’s nightlife. Scholars, 
						like Sarah Schulman, have highlighted how the Israeli government uses cultural events to pinkwash 
						its image. Pinkwashing refers to the strategic use of LGBTQ+ rights or representation in governments, 
						corporations, or institutions to distract from or justify harmful policies, particularly those involving 
						oppression or human rights violations. Israel ‘pinkwashes’ by presenting Tel Aviv as a haven of queer rights,
						 while simultaneously diverting attention from ongoing political and territorial conflicts.

						  The city scene frames itself as progressive, diverse and full of light — often dubbing itself a 
						  “beacon of light." Yet, in reality, it plays a central role in whitewashing Zionism, transforming 
						  apartheid and segregation into a spectacle of carefree escapism. Israeli nightlife markets itself as
						   a place of liberation: queer parties, raves and techno events abound. But one must ask, liberation 
						   from what, and for whom? The fact that these clubs are built on stolen land? That Palestinians are 
						   often unable to enter Tel Aviv without a permit? These contradictions illustrate how spaces that claim 
						   liberation often obscure deep systems of control and exclusion. 

					</p>
					<p>The reality of Israel is that it remains a deeply conservative and religious country, while 
						the scene prides itself on queer inclusivity, meaning the reality and visibility of queer life 
						in nightlife does not always translate to full acceptance in daily life. The irony is stark, the 
						same scene that hosts ‘inclusive’ drag shows and queer events is built upon a massive system of 
						exclusion. Zionists also often peddle narratives such as that ‘Gays for Gaza’ are to be thrown off roofs. 
						It is evident that queer people are used as a tool to pinkwash Israel as the ‘only democracy in the Middle East’
						 — a nation that paradoxically bans same-sex marriage.

						  Both Wark and Boer have examined that spaces like the dance floor, once sites of countercultural expression, are

						  This shift echoes Thatcher’s infamous rejection of ‘society’ in favour of the individual, undermining the very notion of community-driven

						  The dance floor risks becoming an illusion of liberation rather than the real thing. Bringing this back to my investigation, 
						  the question remains: Can nightlife still be reclaimed as a genuinely communal space, or has it become yet another frontier 
						  for the forces it once sought to resist
						</p>

						<p>The popular rise of “luxury” nightlife underscores this transformation. With new types of exorbitant 
							cover charges, VIP sections, exclusive clientele, and sponsorship deals from multinational 
							corporations. These practises often alienate the very communities that originally built these 
							spaces which now define these spaces, championing affluent individuals and social connections. 
							As Thornton (1996),
							<span class="sidenote-wrapper">

							  </span> 
							  , explains, ‘connections in the form of friends, relations, associates and acquaintances can 
							  all bestow status,” ultimately shaping the customer in a specific way, while excluding those unable 
							  to meet financial or aesthetic entry requirements. The commodification of these spaces mirrors their 
							  political underpinnings: both systems reward privilege while masking exclusion with a veneer of 
							  liberation and inclusivity. 
						</p>

						<p>Moreover, the application of surveillance technologies within nightlife, such as facial recognition, 
							enhanced security in and around venues, and digital guest lists, reinforces the idea that exclusionary 
							policies are often implemented under the guise of safety. These measures are frequently utilised to target 
							racialised and queer bodies. Therefore, rendering the space complicit in systems of control and oppression.
							 I would argue that this system also reflects Foucault’s concept of disciplinary power (1975).

							  There are cameras everywhere, watching you and your behaviour. That all-encompassing feeling 
							  of being watched while you are inside or outside a club, and in turn, this feeling of knowing 
							  you are being watched so you may be inclined to act a certain type of way or conform to expected 
							  norms.  
							</p>

							<p>A classic example of this, here in The Netherlands, can be seen in the over-policing of Black,
								 Moroccan, North African, Middle Eastern youth in gentrified urban spaces, particularly in 
								 nightlife. Despite their cultural contributions to the music and the scene, they are often 
								 excluded from these spaces through racial profiling and economic barriers, while their cultural 
								 expressions are commercialised and marketed to affluent audiences. 
							</p>
							<p>As a response to this erosion of communal authenticity, underground raves and DIY club nights

								<p> in London, redefine cultural priorities by centring queer, trans and Black communities, emphasising community driven safety,

									and Black liberation movements, creating environments that explicitly centre those often excluded from mainstream nightlife. 
									Borrowing from David Harvey’s Rebel Cities (2012), such acts can be understood as radical assertion of the “right to the city” 
									not just through occupation but through intentional reimagining — where the dance floor becomes a space of resistance, collective 
									joy, and self-determination. As Harvey states, “the freedom to make and remake ourselves and our cities” is central to 
									urban life, and in these alternative spaces, that freedom is actively practised.

					<h3>The Rottencore: A counter-Narrative</h3>

				  <p>A shift is necessary, yet I recognise that not a single solution can address every issue. While the idea of 
					instant change is appealing, meaningful transformation requires a more focused and incremental approach. 
					By concentrating on smaller, tangible actions, we can create a foundation for broader impact, ensuring 
					that change is not only envisioned but also achievable (Fig 10)

					 <p>The ethos of Rottencore aligns with this idea of resistance, advocating for the radical reclamation of 
						communal spaces and the rejection of capitalism’s commodification of culture. However, resistance must 
						be more than a concept- it requires applied strategies to ensure these spaces remain autonomous and do 
						not fall into the cycle of capitalist recuperation. We can look at real-world creative networks that 
						have attempted to carve out alternative spaces, like ‘Papergirl’, a decentralised street art 
						initiative that was created in Berlin in 2006 (fig 11).

						  Similarly, the existence of creative hubs in London like BeauBeaus—which balance artistic engagement with 
						  the necessity of economic survival. It illustrates the ongoing struggle to maintain radical creative spaces
						   within a capitalist framework. These examples serve as both inspiration and cautionary tales for how 
						   Rottencore can navigate these tensions while remaining a genuine tool of disruption.
						</p>
					</p>
					<p>For Rottencore to be truly disruptive rather than symbolic, it must extend beyond abstraction into direct praxis. 
						Wark’s concept of raving as a site of subversive potential is deeply relevant here - where participants momentarily 
						escape societal pressures and experience a collective resistance outside of traditional frameworks of ownership and
						 control. Rottencore must build upon this by creating a framework for real-life application. If it remains only 
						 a concept, it risks becoming just another aesthetic packaged for commodification. How, then, does ‘rtc’ 
						 function as a genuine alternative?</p>

						 <p>First, rtc must be a living movement, not merely aesthetic or theory. It must thrive on the impermanence of 
							gatherings, art, and actions as intentional resistance to capitalist capture. Just as raving creates a 
							temporary autonomous zone where bodies move freely beyond capitalist logic, Rottencore must carve out 
							cultural spaces that resist market-driven incorporation. Whether through occupation of neglected urban 
							spaces, underground collectives, or decentralised networks of artistic production. Rottencore must
							 actively challenge existing structures by fostering spaces of uncontrolled expression. </p>



					<p>Wark’s concept of raving as a site of subversive potential is deeply relevant here. Participants 
						momentarily escaping societal pressures and structures, experiencing a collective resistance that 
						exists outside traditional frameworks of ownership and control. In a similar way, using this 
						theoretical concept my desire for Rottencore is that it thrives off this radical and subversive 
						potential. It embraces the impermanence of gatherings, art, and action as a means of defying 
						commodification. Just as raving creates a temporary autonomous zone where bodies move freely 
						between capitalist logic, Rottencore seeks to carve out a culture where community and creativity 
						can exist outside of commercial demands. The act of coming together, whether through physical events 
						or shared digital movements, becomes an act of defiance in itself, reinforcing the idea that resistance 
						is not always about permanence but about the continual creation of alternative ways of being.
					</p>
					<p>
						A convincing example of this kind of creative self-organisation is ‘Papergirl’ the street art 
						project that was previously mentioned. Artists were asked to submit works that are exhibited and 
						then distributed by bicycle to random passers-by, disrupting traditional art market structures. (Fig 12)

					<p>By transforming public spaces into dynamic artistic hubs, Papergirl embodies the ethos of resistance
						 through secretive distribution and accessibility. Similarly, rtc can function as a means of subverting 
						 the commodification of culture by ensuring that creative expressions remain freely shared, unbound by 
						 commercial constraints.
					</p>

					<p>An example that illustrates the complexities of balancing creative autonomy with economic survival is ‘BeauBeaus’, 
						a creative hub and café in London that hosts workshops and artistic activities while simultaneously functioning 
						and a business. (Fig 13)

				</figure>
				<p> Spaces like BeauBeaus attempt to navigate the tensions between fostering genuine creative community and the realities of 
					economic sustainability. Their positioning reflects a broader dilemma: they promote artistic collaboration and engagement 
					while ultimately needing to operate within the capitalist framework to survive. As their own statement suggests, ‘ a
					 beautiful space can inspire creativity and productivity, ’ reinforcing the gentrified logic that creative work must 
					 be performed within structured, monetised environments.

					  </span>
					  While they provide essential platforms for grassroots cultural engagement, they also face the challenge of 
					  needing to sell products and generate revenue. This highlights the fine line between maintaining 
					  authenticity and accessibility while resisting the pressures of commercialisation. Rottencore must 
					  critically engage with these found tensions, exploring ways to sustain alternative creative spaces 
					  without succumbing to market- driven compromises that dilute their radical potential. 
					</p>
					<p>Second, Rottencore must function as a tool for organisers, artists, and citizens who refuse to participate 
						in the consumption of culture. What can someone do with rtc if this ideology speaks to them as a raver, organiser, 
						neighbour, or disobedient citizen? Rather than simply, highlighting decay and loss, it must provide the means to 
						create - new spaces, new connections, and new ways of resisting the erosion of communal existence. This could
					 manifest as DIY event infrastructures, radical publishing, disruptive urban interventions, or collective-run 
					 creative pop-ups. </p>

					 <p>
						Third, ’rtc' must differentiate itself from mere nostalgia. While it recognises the historical patterns of 
						grassroots organising, its purpose is not to replicate past-movements but to build a forward thinking, adaptable 
						framework. One that operates realistically within the constraints of capitalism while actively proposing real,
						 practical alternatives. If resistance remains aesthetic, it risks being absorbed by the very system it seeks to 
						 reject. Instead, rtc must remain in a state of constant evolution, staying one-step ahead of co-optation through 
						 proactive engagement and continuous reinvention. 
					 </p>
					 <p>
						To prevent rtc from being cannibalised by capitalism, it must resist the cycle of commodification that often 
						absorbs underground culture. This means ensuring rottencore’s spaces and practises remain decentralised, 
						collectively owned, and resistant to external commercialisation. It needs to prioritise autonomy over branding, 
						collective action over spectacle, and temporary interventions over static institutions. The moment Rottencore 
						becomes a product it loses its radical potential. To counteract this, it must rely on fluid, self-organised networks 
						that reject hierarchal structures, ensuring it remains a tool for hopeful change rather than be a marketable trend. 
					 </p>

					 <p>Fundamentally, Rottencore must be more than aesthetic or nostalgic longing for past forms of resistance. It 
						must be a living methodology, an evolving toolkit that is shared by those who engage with it. This means rejecting
						 passive participation and instead encouraging direct action.  Whether through reclaiming, neglected spaces, 
						 forming underground creative collectives, or designing infrastructures that exist outside the control of traditional
						  institutions.  What can someone do with Rottencore today? This is the question that must guide its evolution. If 
						  it is to remain radical, it cannot simply critique - it must build. It must offer a blueprint for creative rebellion 
						  that not only resists capitalist co-optation but actively prevents its absorption into the system it seeks to dismantle.

					<p>To put Rottencore into practice, I will focus on creating decentralised, autonomous spaces that reject capitalist
						 commodification while fostering genuine communal engagement. This will involve DIY event infrastructures, radical 
						 publishing, and disruptive urban interventions that prioritise impermanence and fluidity over static institutions.
						  By forming networks of underground creatives, reclaiming neglected spaces, and facilitating collective-run initiatives,
						   Rottencore will act as both a methodology and a toolkit for resistance. It will not be a passive critique but an active 
						   force- one that continuously adapts to evade co-optation, ensuring that it remains a living, evolving framework for 
						   cultural disruption.

					<h3>Speculation and thoughts</h3>
				  </div>
				<p>By examining the transformation of nightlife and urban spaces and culture under capitalist structures, this project 
					interrogates how grassroots movements can resist commercialisation of social interactions and foster spaces that
					 prioritise the shared experience. Through this thesis, Rottencore has emerged as a critique and a methodological 
					 response to the commodification of community, urban spaces, and culture. Rather than existing solely as a conceptual 
					 framework, rtc materialises through design, discourse, and activation. With the aim of reclaiming communal spaces as sites of resistance.

				</p>
				<p>The dance floor and music events exemplify how communal spaces have historically functioned as sites of liberation, creativity and 
					solidarity. This parallels a broader societal shift, where urban environments prioritise profit over people enable the disappearance 
					of these creative or social experiences. Rottencore challenges narratives by embodying a grassroots approach that resist commodification 
					and seeks to foster authentic gatherings where people can come together, share, and belong. The concept of Rottencore underscores the power
				 of community to transform and reclaim spaces, fostering environments where creativity thrives beyond institutional or corporate boundaries. 
				 It invites us to question the systems that fragments our communal experiences and create new possibilities for inclusive, sustainable 
				 spaces that nurture connection and culture. 
				</p>

				<p>As society continues to navigate the blurred lines between, culture, commerce, and community, projects like Rottencore remind us that 
					reclaiming our spaces and fostering genuine interactions are acts of resistance. This thesis serves as a call to action for designers, 
					creatives, and communities to take ownership of their environments and create spaces that celebrate the spirit of togetherness, creatively 
					and most importantly defiance.
