		<h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
	  </div>

	  <p>
		The Capitalist systems drive the commodification of urban spaces and culture in cities worldwide. As a result,
		many communal areas in urban spaces have been transformed into profit-driven commodities, erasing their original
		purpose as spaces for resistance, belonging, and creativity.</p>
		<p>This thesis aims to investigate how capitalism prioritises the commercial interests of urban development over 
		what is good for the neighbourhood - or public good. This dynamic frequently results in gentrification,
		the privatisation of public spaces, and a loss of authenticity in cultural expressions.</p> 
		<p>To deepen this understanding, the thesis examines the concept of community by exploring key ideas through the lens of existing theories, particularly focusing on the commodification of raving and club culture. Once grassroots spaces for collective expression and subcultural resistance, these venues have increasingly been co-opted by corporate interests, stripping them of their radical potential and transforming them into profit-driven enterprises. By exploring case studies of urban spaces, particularly within nightlife culture, I illustrate these dynamics and their real-world consequences.
		By addressing the global intersections of urban space, culture, community and capitalism, this essay is dedicated to 
		representing a desire to reclaim spaces that are committed to the fostering of creativity, connection and expression.

					The world is visibly decaying before our eyes, a decline accelerated
					by capitalism’s relentless grip on society and the natural world. As
					Mark Fisher argues in <em>Capitalist Realism</em> , capitalism presents itself
					as the only viable system, making it nearly impossible to imagine
					alternatives while continuing its cycle of extraction and
					commodification. This all-encompassing force that leaves no corner
					untouched, eroding both communal spaces and the environment in
					pursuit of profit.

				<p>
					My inquiry is deeply personal, as it stems from my own experiences as a graphic designer and as 
					as an individual who has witnessed firsthand this erosion of my own community and communal spaces. 
					My practise as a designer has always been motivated by politics and narratives - an approach that 
					I extend to this research. At the heart of this investigation is a critical reflection of capitalism 
					and neoliberal ideologies, which I argue are the most impactful forces behind the commodification
					 of community and the privatisation of public spaces within Europe and Western countries. I 
					 acknowledge that capitalism and commodification are global phenomena, shaping communities 
					 and public spaces beyond the regions in the scope of this essay. 

				</p>
				<p>To frame this discussion, I draw on key theoretical frameworks that dissect these processes. Mackenzie 
					Warks’ (2023) concept of raving as ‘subversive space’ offers insights into how underground communities 
					carve out spaces of resistance. While, Rene Boer’s (2023) notion of the <em>‘Smooth City’</em> highlights 
					this idea of sanitised, uniform urban landscapes produced by gentrification. These frameworks will enable 
					me to interrogate how power operates in urban and cultural contexts, revealing found tensions between 
					resistance and co-optation.</p>

				<p>My approach is both critical and speculative. This thesis not only critiques the current status quo but 
					also attempts to speculate and reimagine alternatives, informed by my own design practise and
					 the ethos of grassroots movements. A central aspect to my methodology is an exploration of how 
					 communal spaces can be reclaimed or redefined. By examining examples such as dance floors and clubs- 
					 a literal space where people physically come together for collective joy and creativity - I attempt to 
					 highlight how these types of environments resist commodification and offer small glimpses of more hopeful future.
				</p>
				<p>In naming this project ‘Rottencore’, I acknowledge the duality of decay and renewal, inherent in 
					the struggles for community and cultural agency. In the same way rotting matter nourishes new growth,
					 I envision a reclamation of spaces and cultures that hopefully defines the neoliberal agenda(s) and foster 
					 real genuine connections.  Therefore, this thesis is both a critique and a manifesto of sorts -
					  a call to resist, reimagine and rebuild. </p>

					<h3>The Capitalist enclosure </h3>
				  </div>

				  <h3>of culture and space</h3>

				<p class="no-indent">
					Rene Boer’s concept of the ‘Smooth City’ provides a compelling framework for examining the capitalist transformation of urban environments and its impact on communal spaces and culture. the Smooth City prioritises clean, controlled, and predictable environments that cater to affluent tourists and residents, leading to the systematic erasure of “rough spaces”. Diverse, informal areas that foster cultural and social dynamism. This chapter critically explores how capitalism reshapes urban space, diminishing the spontaneity and inclusivity that once defied them. 
				</p>
				<div class="sub-heading"><h4>2.2 A capitalist blueprint</h4></div>
				<p class="no-indent">Boer describes the Smooth City as an urban landscape that is characterised by homogeneity, predictability and control. He writes, ‘there is no friction, no dirt, no contrast, no noise, and no smells’, illustrating the meticulously curated environments stripped of the chaotic energy and diverse elements that give urban life a vibrant flavour. Boer further notes that, ‘the smooth City welcomes everyone but provides space for no one,’ highlighting its inherent contradiction as an inclusive yet alienating environment.

					  </span>
					  It thrives on curated aesthetics and controlled experiences, creating a facade of openness while erasing the unpredictable and organic elements that define authentic urban life. Urban life thrives on spontaneity — the unplanned encounters, the conversations with strangers, the subtle dance of different cultures coexisting in a shared space. However, these moments are disappearing. Imagine walking through a city where everything feels curated, every public space designed to discourage lingering. Boer’s description suggests that this controlled environment strips away the friction and unpredictability that once made cities so vibrant. Without these informal interactions — those types of chance exchanges between people from different classes, backgrounds, and ways of life — urban spaces risk becoming sterile and drab, losing the very energy that makes them dynamic and diverse.
					</p>
					<p>Another defining aspect of the Smooth City is in its relentless pursuit of efficiency and commercial viability. Boer illustrates how this dynamic involves the process of, ‘further blending the public domain with commercial activity’,

						  </span>
						  essentially blurring the lines between communal and consumer spaces, often at the expense of democratic engagement and inclusivity. Furthermore, Boer observes that the Smooth City, ‘is a place where everything is frictionless, yet nothing is truly free” (2023). This frictionless quality seems to stem from the idea of the meticulous planning and privatisation of spaces, which again further stifles spontaneity and creativity in favour of order and marketability.

						  It presents itself as an open and inclusive public space, its transformation embodies the very qualities that Boer critiques: hyper-curated, commercially driven, and selectively accessible. Therefore, the space fosters consumption rather than organic social interactions, subtly discouraging loitering or non-commercial activity. Instead of serving as truly democratic urban common space, De Hallen exemplifies how urban renewal often repackages these communal spaces into the frictionless, marketable experiences that Boer describes. Further reinforcing the blur between public and private space in a way that drives away genuine community-driven use, prioritising the controlled engagement.  
						</p>
						<p>Under capitalism, cities are not merely places where people come to work, live and gather but have now become arenas for perpetual cycle of economic growth. The aesthetic and functional aspects of urban spaces are tailored to attract these capital investments. 
						</p>

						<div class="sub-heading"><h4>2.3 Commodification of Space</h4></div>
						<p class="no-indent">The capitalist imperative is essentially to commodify everything it touches, which fundamentally alters the purpose and accessibility of urban space. We see it everywhere from public squares, parks and other communal venues.</p>

						<p>Boer discusses the notion of ‘hegemonic practices’ being ‘practically unescapable’

							  and the way in which it underscores the ways in which power structures subtly, yet pervasively, dictate urban life and social interactions. These practises, that are always masked in the guise of being convenient or modern, create these homogenised city experience, which quite frankly is boring and lacking energy. Dissent and alternative modes of gathering become increasingly marginalised this way. This hegemony blurs the lines between participation and consumption, and as Boer states, it makes it ‘almost impossible to take a critical distance

								  Once defined by its rough edges - abandoned warehouses, studios, cultural hubs - Bijlmer became a site of organic communities and resilience. However, its redevelopment has followed the familiar pattern of urban ‘improvement,’ where upscale apartments, boutiques and trendy cafes replace the every spaces that one nurtured community-driven culture. These transformations are displacing the very communities that imbued these spaces with cultural energy. Urban planner Wouter Pokornie advocated for an alternative approach, one that redirects gentrification towards emancipation rather than exclusion. This ensures that existing communities can benefit rather than being pushed out. However, the dominant model of urban renewal in Bijlmer aligns with neoliberal interest, once again prioritising commercial viability over social cohesion.

								  These are sanitised environments that are curated to appeal to specific people. Therefore, we come to a conclusion that the cityscape results in prioritising capital and profit over people, reinforcing this idea that being different is a bad thing or stifling cultural diversity or other social inequalities.
 								</p>
								<div class="sub-heading"><h4>2.4: Cultural Erosion and the Spectacle of authenticity</h4></div>
								<p class="no-indent">Obviously, capitalism’s influence extends beyond physical spaces to cultural practices and expressions, increasingly dictating where and how communities can authentically gather. Cultural practises once rooted in specific traditions and communities, are forcibly being appropriated, commodified and re-packaged for mass consumption. Take, for example, how street art, almost instantly is co-opted by corporations seeking to capitalise on their subcultural appeal, yet as the Smooth City notes, ‘graffiti tags on a newly built overpass will be quickly removed to make sure it won’t become a popular place for youngsters to add their own tags.

								</p>
								<p>Corporations and municipalities are curating experiences what they deem as acceptable, essentially limiting activities or spaces where authentic community can thrive. This manufactured  spectacle of authenticity markets curated versions of are as “real” experiences. However, these commodified representations are deeply lacking depth, context and meaning of their original forms. Using the dance floor as another example, a once radical space for self-expression and communal connection - a site now that is often an area of commodification, where access is determined by ticket prices and VIP exclusivity. 
								</p>
								<p>In a landscape where communal spaces are increasingly policed or commercialised, the question becomes: where can we still go to gather, or create, or even connect in a genuine normal way.

					<h3>The commodified dance-floor</h3>
				  </div>

				<p>
					From the moment I was legally able to, I found joy in going out with my friends and exploring 
					the nightlife and venues that different cities had to offer. Dancing has always stirred a 
					profound feeling within me — whether it’s a rush of euphoria or an unexpected sense of calm. 
					It’s a fleeting tranquility, a moment where I feel free to move and express myself without inhibition. 
					However, in recent years, I have also become increasingly aware of how these spaces are being 
					encroached upon by an ever-expanding capitalist system. What was once authentic, 
					healing communities built on inclusivity are now being eroded, leaving behind a stark contrast 
					to their original purpose. This transformation signals the death of the dance floor.
				</p>

				<p>We must first acknowledge the origins of dance music before focusing on the dance floor and its 
				commodification. Dance music’s roots trace back to the late 1970s and 1980s, when techno emerged as
			 a response to Detroit’s post-industrial decline. The music was created as a response to the urban decay 
			 many cities in the United States faced at the time. (fig 4) </p>
			 
			 <p>Pioneers like Kevin Saunderson, Juan Atkins, and
			 Derrick May — known as the “Belleville Three” (fig 5) —
			 fused elements of soul, funk and other futuristic sounds,
			 influenced by European pioneers like Kraftwerk.

					  <p>Detroit’s underground scene thrived in the infrastructure left behind, allowing marginalised communities

				</p>

				<p>In Raving, McKenzie Wark presents raves as spaces of subversive potential — fleeting moments where participants
					 momentarily escape the rigid structures of capitalist society.

					  </span> 
					  However, this potential is increasingly compromised as rave culture becomes commodified. What once emerged 
					  as a grassroots movement rooted in resistance has been appropriated, stripped of its radical intent, and 
					  repackaged for mainstream consumption. The gabber scene in The Netherlands would be another illustration 
					  of this type of commodification; originally a raw and rebellious underground movement, it was eventually 
					  absorbed into the mainstream, with its aesthetics and sound repackaged for commercial appeal, stripping it
					   of its radical root. Similarly, theorists like Hakim Bey, in Temporary Autonomous Zones,

					   argue that these ephemeral gatherings create “zones of freedom” where the oppressive forces of capital and 
					   state control momentarily disappear. These temporary spaces, though precarious and short-lived, possess 
					   the power to disrupt the sanitised, controlled, and commodified nature of contemporary nightlife. 
					   They reimagine the dance floor not just as a site of entertainment, but as a radical space for communal
					   resistance and liberation. 
					</p>
					<p>The underground rave scenes of the 1980s and 1990s emerged as acts of defiance against restrictive laws and 
						societal constraints. These raves provided a space that offered liberation from mainstream venues covered 
						by rigid rules, high costs and social discrimination. Raving typically took place in abandoned warehouses, 
						fields, and other hidden locations to avoid police crackdowns and evade licensing regulations that controlled 
						nightlife spaces. In contrast, large-scale music festivals, corporate-sponsored club nights, and curated playlists
						 have reduced rave culture to a marketable aesthetic, diluting its political and social significance (Fig 6).

						  <p>The commodification of raves exemplifies a broader trend: capitalism’s ability to neutralise 
						  resistance by turning it into a product.
						</p>

						<p>In addition to raves, nightclubs have always served as important spaces for youth subcultures. 
							They offer an environment where people can engage in forming their own identity, self-expression 
							and a sense of belonging to a social group. In the frame of these spaces, music, style, and shared 
							experiences become key tools for navigating personal and collective identities. Within these spaces, 
							they offer a momentary escape from social constraints and expectations.

							  refers to the concept of how such spaces transform 
							  from “representational spaces”, filled with this energy or what Lefebvre names radical
							   potential into these “spaces of representation”, which are then restructured to align with

							   radical potential have been restricted to align with dominant capitalist and political ideologies.

					<p> A particularly striking example of this shift can be found in Tel Aviv’s nightlife. Scholars, 
						like Sarah Schulman, have highlighted how the Israeli government uses cultural events to pinkwash 
						its image. Pinkwashing refers to the strategic use of LGBTQ+ rights or representation in governments, 
						corporations, or institutions to distract from or justify harmful policies, particularly those involving 
						oppression or human rights violations. Israel ‘pinkwashes’ by presenting Tel Aviv as a haven of queer rights,
						 while simultaneously diverting attention from ongoing political and territorial conflicts.

						  The city scene frames itself as progressive, diverse and full of light — often dubbing itself a 
						  “beacon of light." Yet, in reality, it plays a central role in whitewashing Zionism, transforming 
						  apartheid and segregation into a spectacle of carefree escapism. Israeli nightlife markets itself as
						   a place of liberation: queer parties, raves and techno events abound. But one must ask, liberation 
						   from what, and for whom? The fact that these clubs are built on stolen land? That Palestinians are 
						   often unable to enter Tel Aviv without a permit? These contradictions illustrate how spaces that claim 
						   liberation often obscure deep systems of control and exclusion. 

					</p>
					<p>The reality of Israel is that it remains a deeply conservative and religious country, while 
						the scene prides itself on queer inclusivity, meaning the reality and visibility of queer life 
						in nightlife does not always translate to full acceptance in daily life. The irony is stark, the 
						same scene that hosts ‘inclusive’ drag shows and queer events is built upon a massive system of 
						exclusion. Zionists also often peddle narratives such as that ‘Gays for Gaza’ are to be thrown off roofs. 
						It is evident that queer people are used as a tool to pinkwash Israel as the ‘only democracy in the Middle East’
						 — a nation that paradoxically bans same-sex marriage.

						  diversity while failing to ensure real safety or equity. The dance floor risks becoming an illusion of 
						  liberation rather than the real thing. Bringing this back to my investigation, the question remains: 
						  Can nightlife still be reclaimed as a genuinely communal space, or is it being increasingly co-opted 
						  by the very forces it once sought to resist?  
						</p>
						<p>The popular rise of “luxury” nightlife underscores this transformation. With new types of exorbitant 
							cover charges, VIP sections, exclusive clientele, and sponsorship deals from multinational 
							corporations. These practises often alienate the very communities that originally built these 
							spaces which now define these spaces, championing affluent individuals and social connections. 
							As Thornton (1996),
							<span class="sidenote-wrapper">

								<input type="checkbox" id="sn-24" class="margin-toggle" />

							  </span> 
							  , explains, ‘connections in the form of friends, relations, associates and acquaintances can 
							  all bestow status,” ultimately shaping the customer in a specific way, while excluding those unable 
							  to meet financial or aesthetic entry requirements. The commodification of these spaces mirrors their 
							  political underpinnings: both systems reward privilege while masking exclusion with a veneer of 
							  liberation and inclusivity. 
						</p>

						<p>Moreover, the application of surveillance technologies within nightlife, such as facial recognition, 
							enhanced security in and around venues, and digital guest lists, reinforces the idea that exclusionary 
							policies are often implemented under the guise of safety. These measures are frequently utilised to target 
							racialised and queer bodies. Therefore, rendering the space complicit in systems of control and oppression.
							 I would argue that this system also reflects Foucault’s concept of disciplinary power (1975).

							  </span> 
							  The concept refers to the subtle, pervasive ways institutions and systems regulate behaviour, 
							  shape identities, and maintain control through surveillance, norms, and self-regulation rather 
							  than direct force.

							  There are cameras everywhere, watching you and your behaviour. That all-encompassing feeling 
							  of being watched while you are inside or outside a club, and in turn, this feeling of knowing 
							  you are being watched so you may be inclined to act a certain type of way or conform to expected 
							  norms.  
							</p>

							<p>A classic example of this, here in The Netherlands, can be seen in the over-policing of Black,
								 Moroccan, North African, Middle Eastern youth in gentrified urban spaces, particularly in 
								 nightlife. Despite their cultural contributions to the music and the scene, they are often 
								 excluded from these spaces through racial profiling and economic barriers, while their cultural 
								 expressions are commercialised and marketed to affluent audiences. 
							</p>
							<p>As a response to this erosion of communal authenticity, underground raves and DIY club nights 
								employ a range of tactics that challenge the logic of the “smooth nightlife”. While some reject formal 
								licensing and corporate sponsorship outright, others redefine cultural priorities, emphasising 
								community-driven safety, accessibility, and collective care over profit. These spaces are shaped 
								by principles rooted in social organising, mutual aid, and Black liberation movements, 
								creating environments that explicitly centre those often excluded from mainstream nightlife. 
								Borrowing from David Harvey’s Rebel Cities (2012), such acts can be understood as radical assertion of 
								the “right to the city” not just through occupation but through intentional reimagining — 
								where the dance floor becomes a space of resistance, collective joy, and self-determination. 
								As Harvey states, “the freedom to make and remake ourselves and our cities” is central to urban life, 
								and in these alternative spaces, that freedom is actively practised.

								</p>
								<p>Ultimately, while the commercialisation of nightlife has stripped many spaces of their
									 subversive energy, transforming them into the sanitised, exclusive environments that 
									 cater to the affluent crowds, the resilience of DIY spaces and underground movements 
									 offers a stark contrast. Unlike the controlled, profit-hungry “smooth” nightlife, 
									 these grassroots spaces reject over-policing and economic barriers, reclaiming the
									  dance floor as a site of resistance and radical joy for those who have long been excluded 
									  from mainstream nightlife.

					<h3>The Rottencore: A counter-Narrative</h3>
				  </div>

				  <p>A shift is necessary, yet I recognise that not a single solution can address every issue. While the idea of 
					instant change is appealing, meaningful transformation requires a more focused and incremental approach. 
					By concentrating on smaller, tangible actions, we can create a foundation for broader impact, ensuring 
					that change is not only envisioned but also achievable (Fig 8).

					 <p>The ethos of ‘Rottencore’ aligns with this idea of resistance, advocating for the reclamation of 
						communal spaces and the rejection of capitalism commodification. By fostering environments where 
						creativity and community take precedence over profit, Rottencore essentially challenges the paradigm 
						of the Smooth City and also establishes moments of subversive potential based on the ideas of the 
						findings in my research. The focus on communal gatherings underscores the importance of authenticity
						 and collective empowerment in the face or drastic capitalist homogenisation. 
					</p>
					<p>Wark’s concept of raving as a site of subversive potential is deeply relevant here. Participants 
						momentarily escaping societal pressures and structures, experiencing a collective resistance that 
						exists outside traditional frameworks of ownership and control. In a similar way, using this 
						theoretical concept my desire for Rottencore is that it thrives off this radical and subversive 
						potential. It embraces the impermanence of gatherings, art, and action as a means of defying 
						commodification. Just as raving creates a temporary autonomous zone where bodies move freely 
						between capitalist logic, Rottencore seeks to carve out a culture where community and creativity 
						can exist outside of commercial demands. The act of coming together, whether through physical events 
						or shared digital movements, becomes an act of defiance in itself, reinforcing the idea that resistance 
						is not always about permanence but about the continual creation of alternative ways of being.
					</p>
					<p>
						The way I view Rottencore is as an ever-evolving concept, a fluid ideology that resists definition in 
						the traditional sense. At its core, ‘rtc’
						<span class="sidenote-wrapper">
							<label for="sn-29" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
							<input type="checkbox" id="sn-29" class="margin-toggle" />
							<span class="sidenote">
								“rtc” is just the shorthand of Rottencore for now.
						  </span> 
						  </span>
						  embodies rebellion, adaptability and reclamation. It challenges the stagnation of societal norms 
						  and reimagines the spaces that we inhabit - physically, culturally, and emotionally. As briefly 
						  mentioned before, the term suggests both decay and renewal, reflecting the tensions found within 
						  modern society. A world where community spaces are commodified, creativity is constrained by 
						  consumerism, and the idea of ‘belonging’ has become increasingly transactional. Therefore, 
						  Rottencore thrives in this contradiction, taking shape in whatever form its audience requires. 
						  It could be a physical gathering one day, a provocative piece of work the next, or even just a 
						  place to start a new movement that could live entirely online. The beauty of Rottencore lies in its 
						  refusal to be pinned down - the vision I have means it is constantly in flux, adapting to the needs 
						  of the moment.  
						</p>
						<p>
							I would argue that this adaptability would allow Rottencore to function as a collective
							 framework for rethinking community and identity. It aims to empower those who want to resist 
							 some of the forces that have been discussed in this essay in order to reclaim what has been lost 
							 — be it shared spaces, creative freedom, resistance, or genuine human connections —  
							 By transforming the use of the word ‘rotten’ into something more generative. Rottencore 
							 is both a mirror and a tool, reflecting the fractures of society while offering a means to
							  bridge them. It is not prescriptive but participatory, inviting audiences to shape its 
							  meaning and manifestation. This fluidity ensures Rottencore is never static; it exists to 
							  serve the communities evolving needs, becoming whatever form of resistance or creativity the 
							  moment demands.

<!-- CONCLUSION -->
			<section id="conclusion"> 
				<h2 id="conclusion">CONCLUSION:</h2>
				<div class="chapter-title">
					<h3>Speculation and thoughts</h3>
				  </div>
				<p>Through this thesis, Rottencore has emerged as a critique and creative response to the commodification of
					 community, urban spaces, and culture. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The dance floor and music events exemplify how communal spaces have historically functioned 
					as sites of liberation, creativity and solidarity. This parallels a broader societal shift, where 
					urban environments prioritise profit over people, restricting access to creative or social experiences. 
					Rottencore challenges thus narratives by embodying a grassroots approach that resist commodification and 
					seeks to foster authentic gatherings where people can come together, share, and belong.
				</p>
				<P>The concept of Rottencore underscores the power of community to transform and reclaim spaces, fostering environments where creativity thrives beyond institutional or corporate boundaries. It invites us to question the systems that fragments our communal experiences and create new possibilities for inclusive, sustainable spaces that nurture connection and culture. 
				</P>
				<p>As society continues to navigate the blurred lines between, culture, commerce, and community, projects like Rottencore remind us that reclaiming our spaces and fostering genuine interactions are acts of resistance. This thesis serves as a call to action for designers, creatives, and communities to take ownership of their environments and create spaces that celebrate the spirit of togetherness, creatively and most importantly defiance.
