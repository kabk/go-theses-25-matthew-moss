        <h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
        <p>
          The capitalist system is the driving force of the commodification of
          urban spaces and culture, and in turn has transformed a plethora of
          communal areas into profit-hungry commodities, seeing the erasure of
          their function and original purpose as locations for resistance,
          belonging and creativity.
        </p>
        <p>
          This thesis, aims to investigate how capitalism prioritises the
          commercial interests, within urban development, over what is good for
          the neighbourhood - or public good. This dynamic frequently results in
          gentrification, the privatisation of public spaces, and a loss of
          authenticity in cultural expressions. To deepen this understanding,
          the thesis examines the concept of community by exploring key ideas
          through the lens of existing theories. The focus is on demonstrating
          how the capitalist system has subverted and twisted the word,
          ‘community’ to become another avenue for profit. Case studies of urban
          spaces are used to illustrate these dynamics and their real-world
          consequences.
        </p>
        <p>
          By addressing the global intersections of urban space, culture,
          community and capitalism, this thesis is dedicated to representing a
          desire to reclaim spaces that are dedicated to the fostering of
          creativity, connection and expression.

          All it takes is a single moment to start something. Then lot's of
          repetition and level of consitency that allows something to gain
          momentum.
